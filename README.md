# DNA-Digestion
Python code, modeling a digestion of a DNA sequence using one or more enzymes.

## Project statement

Write a program which, from a restriction enzyme, gives the result of the digestion of a sequence by this enzyme. That is, the program gives the number of fragments and their length. It will also be able to give, the fragments sorted by length (as in a migration). Suggest a menu for that.

Secondly, digestion will take place by one or more enzymes that will be choosen by the user.
